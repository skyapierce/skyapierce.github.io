        <h2>Material</h2>
        <hr />
    <p>
        The modern paperclip is nearly always made from a complex carbon treated alloy of iron, called steel. 
            <br>
        Steel is a material unique for a variety of factors, nearly all of which help to correct the natural errors of more traditional iron and cast iron products. 
            <br> 
        In its purest form iron is vulnerable to a factor coined in the early 1900's, as "Taylors Dislocation" which represents the ease of atoms within a given material to shift and play. 
            <br>
        In modern times, and especially when documenting the factors of more complicated materials, we tend to refer to this maluable flexable trait as <i>ductility</i>. 
            <br>
        Ductile metals are metals that can easily be shaped and used by humans, metals with incredibly high "stretch-abillity/flexabillity" are materials like silver, platinum, iron, copper and gold.
            <br> 
        Gold is so incredibly ductile that a single gram of gold can be stretched and shaped into a wire nearly 2,300 meters long! 
            <br> 
        So why you might ask is ductility a weakness of iron based products? And moreover, why would you want to inhibit or lessen that quallity? The answer lies in another quallity called <i>hardness</i>.
            <br> 
        hardness is the abillity of a material to resist indentation or abrasion, and is nearly synonomous with the term "strength". 
            <br> 
        If it helps, picture iron as a limber and agile runner, who can move quickly and adapt to strange and various pressures, trying out for the football team.
            <br>
        while the speed and agility of the individual would likely serve them well, without a viable ammount of strength or resiliance, the runner would likely be outright destroyed.
            <br> 
        with this metaphore in hand, steel is a runners thicker, beefier cousin. Far stronger, and slightly slower, Steel preforms overall with admirable grace, and intense strength.
