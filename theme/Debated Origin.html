        <h2>The Vaalar Claim</h2>
        <p>
            In the year 1901, a Norwegean officer manager by the name of Johan Vaalar, submitted a request for reveiw of a device that would bind multiple lengths of paper to one another.
            <br> 
            This is widely regarded as the first submission in the world to a patent office on the topic of paperclips, however this design was not the modern paper binding device we know today.
            <br> 
            for example, the Vaalar clip had a tendancy to fold under pressure of four or more doccuments on account of its two bend structure, and functioned more similarly to a reverse coil spring found in an "aligator clip".

            In reality the father of the modern clip, was likely an American named William Middlebrooke
