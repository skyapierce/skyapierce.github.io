        <h2>The Vaalar Claim</h2>
        <p>
            In the year 1901, a Norwegean officer manager by the name of Johan Vaalar, submitted a request for reveiw of a device that would bind multiple lengths of paper to one another.
            <br> 
            This is widely regarded as the first submission in the world to a patent office on the topic of modern paperclips, however this design was not the modern paper binding device we know today.
            <br> 
            for example, the Vaalar clip had a tendancy to fold under pressure of four or more doccuments on account of its two bend structure, and functioned more similarly to a reverse coil spring found in an "aligator clip".
            <br> 
            In reality the father of the modern clip, was likely an American named William Middlebrooke, who patented not only his design for the three loop clip, but also the very mechanism that would be responsible for producing such devices.
