            <p>
                Johan Vaalar was a brilliant student in childhood at what is now refered to as the university of Oslo, and quickly became a prominant figure in the world of Scandinavian inventors.
                <br> 
                Johan quickly found a european market which begged for easy access to paper bindings, one that with his machinist background found easy to fill.
                <br> 
               Johan presented his two turn design for the paperclip to a German patents office, before promptly dying later that year (1910).

                <br> 
                Time passed as it tends to, and the American "gem" clip overtook Johans inferior design. A world war began and ended, automation florished, and the secound world war began.
                <br>
                The German war machine began its firm march into neighboring land, annexing and conquering within a years time, an empire of its own. 
                <br> 
                The planet was asked to choose its side, German, or dead. 
                <br> 
                The time to answer Hitlers question came to the nation of Norway in april of 1940, in the form of an overwhelming invasion force, the Norwegean king evacuated his country without word, moments before his people decided to peacefully surrender.
