            <h2>The Norwegean Use</h2>
            <p>
                Johan Vaalar was a brilliant student in childhood at what is now refered to as the university of Oslo, and quickly became a prominant figure in the world of Scandinavian inventors.
                <br> 
                Johan quickly found a european market which begged for easy access to paper bindings, one that with his machinist background found easy to fill.
                <br> 
               Johan presented his two turn design for the paperclip to a German patents office, before promptly dying later that year (1910).

                <br> 
                Time passed as it tends to, and the American "gem" clip overtook Johans inferior design. A world war began and ended, automation florished in the peaceful years before the secound world war began.
                <br>
                The German war machine began its firm march into the neighboring lands of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France. 
                <br> 
                Annexing and conquering within a years time, an empire of its own, the planet was asked to choose its side, German, or dead. 
                <br> 
                The time to answer Hitlers question came to the nation of Norway in april of 1940, one month before the fall of France, in the form of an overwhelming invasion force, the Norwegean king evacuated his country without word, moments before his people decided to peacefully surrender, choosing German over dead.
                <br>

                    </figure>
                <br> 
                It was a bleak time for the Norwegeans, overthrown and without leadership, they were left to refit railways for German artillery, allow cobblestone roads to be decimated by lines of German tanks, and even the capture and execution of their Jewish population.
                <br> 
                However, between the parades and executions, occasionally came the memories of duty, of country and the king which had abandoned them, some nords pledged to resist. 
                <br> 
                One such unit was the Norwegean 6th Divison, a team of soldiers who refused to give into nazi demands, making brutal raids, before disappearing into the winterswept mountains to the far north.
                <br>
                These brave men, women, and children participated in huge efforts to shuttle Jews across the neutral Swedish border, disrupt nazi supplies, and to remind their exiled king that so long as he breathed, so to did the life of Norway.
                <br> 
                These resistance fighters found out quickly ways to survive, from night raids, to snow covered snipers. 
                <br> 
                In cities, the resistance walked side by side German occupants, dressed in civilian clothing, keeping tabs on military movements, for combat ready resistance members laying low in the cold.
                <br> 
                These resistance members required a way to communicate silently weather they had been recruited by the resistance, without arousing German suspicion, and thus, Johan Vaalar was written into Norwegean legend.
                <br> 
                Rumors drifted between the people about the infamous snow snipers, it started with whispers of some brilliant strategist, or rouge elite unit left by the king. 
                <br> 
                They were a hidden faction, lead and organized by a brilliant unseen genius, a man just famous enough to pique the ears of Norwegean factory workers that may have heard of his company, a man named Johan Vaalar.
                <br> 
                For Norway, the "inventor" of the paperclip became a supernatural figure, and a symbol of Norwegean anti-facism, so much so that resistance members, or any opposition of German occupation, would frequently wear Vaalar clips at their collar to communicate passive resistance to fellow Norwegeans.
                <br> 
                It became a tradition so well known in German occupied areas that the collar worn paperclip could be found across europe, in places like the Warsaw rebellion in Poland, and other political movements to follow the war.

            <h2>The French Use</h2>
            <p>
            In France, resistance was more open, huge swaths of the French army remained after the nations political surrender, and one general took it upon himself to keep the fight alive, his name was Charles de Gaulle, leader of the French resistance.
            <br> 
            The war ended for Germany in 1945, but not for General De Gaulle, quickly he set himself up as chairmen of democratic reconstruction in France and ruled for around 2 years, before fading into the background.
            <br> 
            That is until 1958, when the French president at the time decided he wanted to rewrite the French constitution, asking French patriot and war hero De Gaulle to participate in its redrafting seemed the right thing to do.
            <br> 
            De Gaulle noticed a collapase in French leadership, and found his political party "The Rally of the French People" to have put him forth as candidate for the presidancy.
            <br> 
            Even 14 years after the fall of Nazi Germany, occasionally video of De Gaulles speeches before his inevidable election to the presidency, revealed the stoic paperclip at his collar, alongside a pin of the French flag.
