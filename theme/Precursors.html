                    in the year 1907 opened a factory who at the time had an amazing new productions device, known as a mechanical wire weaver. For the first time in American history metal could be mass produced in stretched and thin shapes.
                                <br>
                    The corporations name was "Western Wire Products" and dedicated most of its production power towards eliminating the need for cloth and feather stuffed mattresses, which could be both far more expensive, and had far shorter lifespan. 
                                <br> 
                    The success of the company, and the rise of the modern mattress was in part brought into the modern age with the help of a fantastic device known as a Cotter Pin.
                                <br>

                    This short warped length of steel or iron, was essential in the complex functions of the wire weaver, and many other peices of machinery to come.
