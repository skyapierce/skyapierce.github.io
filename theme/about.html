        <br> 
        <p>This site is both a collection of all the work I have put into my prog 109 class, and the final form of my midterm project, which details the functions and importance of Paperclips in history.</p>

<p>My name is Sky Pierce, I come from a small coastal town called Gig Harbor, but moved to a dorm on campus about two months ago to hone and develop my childhood interests into a college degree. (here's me moving into my dorm, I was very excited)</p>
<p>I really hope to broaden my technological horizons, take my sloppy self taught impressions about coding and computer languages all around, and carve out a formal practiced understanding of the basics.
        <br>
        I enjoy the idea of everything about computer manipulation, from simple webpage design, to complex topics like machine learning, or game development. I also enjoy watching "The Office" playing video games, writing short stories, and running.</p>
