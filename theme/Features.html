        <h2>Material</h2>
        <hr />
    <p>
        The modern paperclip is nearly always made from a complex carbon treated alloy of iron, called steel. 
            <br>
        Steel is a material unique for a variety of factors, nearly all of which help to correct the natural errors of more traditional iron and cast iron products. 
            <br> 
        In its purest form iron is vulnerable to a factor coined in the early 1900's, as "Taylors Dislocation" which represents the ease of atoms within a given material to shift and play. 
            <br>
        In modern times, and especially when documenting the factors of more complicated materials, we tend to refer to this maluable flexable trait as <i>ductility</i>. 
            <br>
        Ductile metals are metals that can easily be shaped and used by humans, metals with incredibly high "stretch-abillity/flexabillity" and are materials like silver, platinum, iron, copper and gold.
            <br> 
        Gold is so incredibly ductile that a single gram of gold can be stretched and shaped into a wire nearly 2,300 meters long! 
            <br> 
        So why you might ask is ductility a weakness of iron based products? And moreover, why would you want to inhibit or lessen that quallity? The answer lies in another quallity called <i>hardness</i>.
            <br> 
        hardness is the abillity of a material to resist indentation or abrasion, and is nearly synonomous with the term "strength". 
            <br> 
        If it helps, picture iron as a limber and agile runner, who can move quickly and adapt to strange and various pressures, trying out for the football team.
            <br>
        while the speed and agility of the individual would likely serve them well, without a viable ammount of strength or resiliance, the runner would likely be outright destroyed.
            <br> 
        with this metaphore in hand, steel is a runners thicker, beefier cousin. Far stronger, and slightly slower, Steel preforms overall with admirable grace, and intense strength.

    <h2>Design and Properties</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        The modern paperclip is a 2.7 inch length, half gram of steel wire which features 3 distinct loops, one at each end, and a middle loop, which can be easily pryed to different elevations during use.
            <br> 
        The tension created by extending the middle loop away from either end of the device is reapplied over the remaining loops surface area, and remains as a relitivly reliable bond between sheets of thin material.
            <br>
        In recent years many other strange and effective designs have been released, some are multicolored with the intention of becoming harder to lose, while others feature sharp angled, box-like corners for easier grasping and application. 
            <br> 
        However, despite these innovations, the classic, rounded, uncolored "gem" design (the Swedish word for paperclip by the way), has endured nearly 150 years, and remains as the most purchased design on the international market.
